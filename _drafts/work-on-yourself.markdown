Work is force times acceleration.  It’s your exertion in effort in relation to a change in the state of what was there.  And I’m not talking about dinky low exponent changes.  Acceleration is an x^2 concept, so it isn’t concerned with simply what’s there, or with how the world happens to be going along, but with how you change the way in which the world’s going along.  (If you want to get really fancy pants you can exert change in the ways others work and operate at an x^3 level, but, having tried this, I can warn you not to take the choice lightly.)

Work is also bi-directional.  If you apply work to something, it applies an equal and opposite amount of work on you.  In other words, you change too.  If you work in bugs all day long, the bugs will work into you.

So what do you do?

It turns out there’s two things to do with time put toward debugging.  You can either fold the past into the present or the future into the present.  I recommend doing both to degrees that vary depending on your current predicament.

Debugging existing code is a sublime opportunity for you to come to know your own history.  We are historical creatures, in that we have come to be who we are through exactly so many precise things that happened.  There’s no way we can get any perspective on all or them or perfect perspective on any of them, but working to improve your past work is a huge step in that direction.  Knowing who you were as clearly as you’re able and working to identify and change that legacy changes who you are now, hopefully advantageously.

Writing new code with a mind to the that have scuttled through your code and dreams is great stuff to do too.  It’s easy here, though, not to debug yourself before you bequeath your bugs into your next project so watch out.

Anyway, I’m out.
