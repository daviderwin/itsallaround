Thought forgotten, intention faded, passion unrealized, skill undeveloped, opportunity unrealized, love lost, time wasted.

Creativity expressed in a file that's overwritten.  That moment when you dive to the edge of the cliff, reach out to it, feel your fingertips touch but cannot hold on.  That thing falls away from view forever.

Meta concepts so inwardly focused that they spin in the air, wrap themselves in a tight ball and fall into the abyss.
